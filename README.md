# EPA SMS Dispatcher

This is a simple system for [Environmental Protection Agency](http://www.epa.gov.tw/mp.asp) to dispatch its [Substitute Military Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_civilian_service) personnel.

Although this system is designed for EPA, it can be easily modified to fit other departments as well.

## Offline Version

The EPA SMS Dispatcher was originally designed to work offline.
The **offline version** uses HTML and javascripts only and does not need Internet connection.
It can work on any browsers and any computers.

However, the **offline version** cannot save data.
It means that the user has to download current data to his or her computer, and load it from the browser next time. The data is convert and saved in a txt file.

This should not be a big problem to most users.
But some employees may not be so familiar with **offline webpages**.
That's where the online version shows up.

(Actually, the offilne version can save data in the browser's storage. But most employees prefer txt files.)
